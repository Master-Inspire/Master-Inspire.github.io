Kanen'tио:kon: Men came, the forced us to leave.

Connor: You must refuse!

Achilles: Let me tell you something, Connor. Life is not a fairy-tale and there are no happy endings!

Connor: What would you have me do? I made a promise to my people.

Achilles: In you haste to safe the world, take care you don't destroy it

Connor: I realize now that it will take time. That the road is long and shrouded in darkness. It is a road that will not always take me where I wish to go. But I will travel down it nonetheless.

Achilles: Even those men you sought to save have turned their backs on you. Yet you fight, You resist. Why?

Connor: Because no one else will.
