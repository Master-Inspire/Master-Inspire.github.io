Holding the reins of my horse, I walked through my village with a mounting sense of disbelief. As I'd arrived, I'd seen well-tended fields but the village itself was deserted, the longhouse abandoned, the cook fires cold, and the only soul in sight was a grizzled hunter — a white hunter, not a Mohawk — who sat on an upturned pail in front of a fire, roasting something that smelled good on a spit.

He looked at me carefully as I approached, and his eyes went to his musket, which lay nearby, but I waved to say I meant no harm.

He nodded. "If you're hungry, I've got extra," he said genially.

And it did smell good, but I had other things on my mind. "Do you know what happened here? Where is everyone?"

"Gone west. Been a few weeks since they left. Seems some fella from New York was granted the land by Congress. Guess they decided they didn't need approval from those that lived here to settle."

"What?" I said.

"Yup. Seein' it happen more and more. Natives pushed out by traders and ranchers lookin' to expand. Government says they don't take land that's already owned, but, uh... Here you can see otherwise."

"How could this happen?" I asked, turning around slowly, seeing only emptiness where once I had seen the familiar faces of my people — the people I had grown up with.

"We're on our own now," he continued. "No jolly old English parts and labour. Which means we gotta go at it ourselves. Gotta pay for it too. Sellin' land is quick and easy. And not quite so nasty as taxes. And since some say taxes is what started the whole war, ain't no rush to bring'em back. He gave a full, throaty laugh. "Clever men, these new leaders of ours. They know not to push it just yet. Too soon. Too... British." He stared into his fire. "But it will come. Always does."

I thanked him and left him, to go to the longhouse, thinking, as I walked: I have failed. My people were gone — chased away by those I thought would protect them.

As I walked, the amulet around my neck glowed, and I took it from around my neck, held it in my palm and studied it. Perhaps there was one last thing I could do, and that was to save this place from them all, patriots and Templars alike.
