Don't do this, Connor! 

Then what would you propose we do? Sit and watch while the templars take control? We are sworn to stop them. Or have you forgotten? 

Assassins are meant to be quiet, precise. We do not go announcing conspiracies from the rooftops to all who pass by.

Who are you to lecture anyone? You locked yourself away in this crumbling heap and gave up on the brotherhood entirely. Since the day I arrived, you've done nothing but discourage me. And on the rare occasions you've chosen to help, you've  done so little, you may as well have done nothing at all.

How dare you!

Then tell me: on whose watch did the brotherhood falter? Whose inaction allowed the Templar order to grow so large that it now controls an entire nation! 

If I sought to dissuade you, it was because you knew nothing! If I was reluctant to contribute, it was because you were naive. A thousand times you would have died and taken god knows how many with you. Let me tell you something, Connor: life is not a fairy-tale and there are no happy endings.

No. Not when men like you are left in charge.

In you haste to save the world, boy - take care you don't destroy it!
