Why... Why did you do this?

To protect Adams and Hancock - and those they serve. You meant to kill them - 

Kill them? Are you mad? I wanted only parlay. There was so much to discuss. To explain... But you've put an end to that now. 

If you speak the true, then I will carry your last words to them. 

They must lay down their arms. They must stop this war! 

Why them and not the Redcoats? 

Do you not think we asked the same question of the British? These things take time. And it would have succeeded, had you let me play my part...

The part of the puppeteer. 

Better we hold the strings than another. 

No. The strings should be severed. All should be free. 

And we should live forever on castles in the sky. You wield your blade like a man, but your mouth like a child. And more will die now because of that... 

It is better to have faith in something, than none at all...
