You reign over the Colonial coast has come to an end.
 
Is that why you hunted me? Because you thought me an enemy to the cause? You're every bit the fool I was told. 

You brought pain and suffering upon innocent people for nothing but personal gain. 

Pain. Suffering. I set them free. Weeded out the dissenters and empowered the Patriots. So what if was named Admiral. The Revolution needs one and I was the best man for the job. The only man. If not for me, the Continental Navy would remain but a handful of rafts. For all your vision, you Assassins are blind to the truth. 

Enough.

Wait. Let the Randolph die with me. Don't take her as a prize. Please. I want no quarter, just to sink with my ship.
