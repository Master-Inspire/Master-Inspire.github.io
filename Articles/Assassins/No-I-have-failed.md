Ah... long have we waited for you to return. You have done as we asked. You have succeed.

No.I have failed. My people are gone - chased out by those who I thought would protect them...

It is a trade. A sacrifice. And not in vain. For you have found it.

This?

Now you must hide it. Where none shall think to look. And then in time... in time... what once was... shall be...again.

I do not understand...

Nor need you. Only do as we asked. Then you may do as you wish.

But what of my people?

You have saved this place - as was you people's purpose. And that matters most.

It is not enough!

It will never be enough. You strive for that which does not exist. Still you have made a difference. And you will do so again. Remember... you must hide the amulet where none might find it...
