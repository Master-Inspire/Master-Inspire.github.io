## We're different, you and I!

* * *

Dammit. I thought I'd at least live to see another day.

Shame. I want answers. Why did Johnson try and buy my people's land? Why was Pitcairn targeting adams and Hancock? What purpose would Washington's murder have served? Why does your order support the British?

How should I know? the Templars, Lee, big man Haytham. They'as the money. They'as the power. That's the reason I threw in with'em. That's the only reason. Sure, they'ave some sort of vision, for the future too. I didn't give a damn about any of that. They can sing their songs about mankind and it's troubles. They can make their plans and spring their traps, don't bother me none. They paid me so I said yes. Didn't bother to ask who or how or why. Didn't care.

You chose to side with men who would rob us of our humanity simply because it was more profitable?

Wot else is there? I'm not some blind fool who'd give up all I've got on principle. what is principle anyway? Can ya bring it to the bank? Don't look at me like that. We're different, you and I! You're just some blind fool who's always chasin' butterflies. Where as I'm a type of guy who likes to have a beer in one hand and a titty in the other. Thing is, boy, I can have what I seek. Had it, even. You? Your hands will always be empty.
