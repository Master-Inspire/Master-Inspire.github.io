## Farewell

* * *

I never properly said goodbye to you. I was not ready. so here I am. The weight of my responsibilities never seems to diminish. There is always something else that needs fighting for. This is something you never warned me of, maybe because you thought I would have been deterred - you would have been wrong but I know were not accustomed to that. Life carries on here. The people seem happy - they are certainly safe, at least for now. One of my brotherhood asked me something I have been struggling with, what happens if - when - we win? When we stop the Templars? It is a question I certainly do not know the answer to, perhaps you did not either. I miss you. As I miss my mother. I hope all is well with you, wherever you are. Goodbye, old man, until it comes time for me to join you - then I will bother you once again.
