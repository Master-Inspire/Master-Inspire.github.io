## Because no one else will

* * *

Why do you persist...? You put us down. We rise again. You end one plot - we forge another. You try so hard... but it always ends the same... those who know you think you mad and this is why... even those men you sought to save have turned their backs on you. Yet you fight. You resist. Why? 

Because no one else will.
