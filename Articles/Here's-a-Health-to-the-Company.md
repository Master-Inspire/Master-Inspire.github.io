## Here's a Health to the Company

* * *

Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme 

Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine 

Come lift up your voices, all grief to refrain 

For we may or might never all meet here again 

Here's health to the company and one to my lass 

Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass 

Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain 

For we may or might never all meet here again

Here's health to the dear lass that I love so well 

For her style and for her beauty, sure none can excel 

There's a smile upon on her countenance as she sits on my knee 

There is no man in this wide world as happy as me 

So here's health to the company and one to my lass 

Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass 

Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain 

For we may or might never all meet here again 

Our ship lies at anchor, she's ready to dock 

I wish her safe landing without any shock 

If ever I should meet you by land or by sea 

I will always remember your kindness to me 

So here's health to the company and one to my lass 

Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass 

Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain 

For we may or might never all meet here again
