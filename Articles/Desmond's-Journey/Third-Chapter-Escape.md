## Escape

* * *

I wanted out. I wanted my own life. To live my own way. They never guessed what I was doing, because I didn't know what I was doing. I just walked right out. Someone realized I was gone. They shouted. I started running. 

"Desmond! Desmond!"

I just ran and ran. All that training was finally worth something. God, it was so dark when I left. And the forest... endless. I didn't dare take the roads.

"Desmond, where are you?"

Mother, calling out. Begging me to stay. But I wouldn't. I followed the hills down. Down until I hit a stream. I followed that to a river, and from the river to an old access road. I walked for hours that day, the summer sun keeping me warm well into the evening. Found a clearing after dark. Fell asleep beneath the stars. Never had a quieter night. Not before or since. Walking, too scared to hitch a ride. What the hell was I  doing? Lost in the badlands for a day. Felt like a week. Endless ocean of wrinkled earth. Can't believe a place could look so dead. I'm gonna die, aren't I? I'm gonna die here? Finally met some girls from Illinois. So bubbly. So kind. One day drive to Omaha. Another to Chicago. Then, somewhere, someone said to me...

"If you got nothing, you go to New York. That way, if you leave with nothing, people don't ask any. And if you leave with something, you are one lucky son of a bitch."

So that's where I went. New York City. Into skyscrapers and subways. Into filth and folly. Into the maddening crowds.
