## Doubts

* * *

Home. I was born here. The Farm. Yeah. They called it the Farm. My parents, two dozen couples, some kids. A community. Hidden away. Small houses in the Blacks Hills. Right. Clears skies. Wood smoke, wind, and the stink of gasoline. Generators running, day and night. I remember. We lived simply, almost like nomads. So far from everything. Ready to pack up and go at drop of a hat. If we were discovered. If THEY found us. The Farm. It wasn't much of one was it? Not a proper farm. We grew some food. I don't remember any animals though. Maybe a few dogs. 

The Assassins. I was born into it. I didn't choose. It was like... a birthright. You are an Assassin, they told me. What did that even mean? Ever since I was young. They never stopped saying it. You are an Assassin. You are an Assassin. And this is our Creed...

"Nothing is true."

What did that mean? A world without purpose? 

"Everything is permitted." 

Everything is permitted? 

"They're looking for us. And they will not stop until every one of is dead."

Yeah, I believed for a while, but I never understood. That's the trouble when you're born into something. Belief without understanding. Everyone was so serious. Scared too. All that talk of Assassins and Templars. The end of the world. 

"Live by the Creed, Desmond. Empower yourself."

Every man has his limit, I guess. I can't remember when I stopped believing. When I stopped caring. God, it all sounded so stupid. I couldn't hear the word Templar without laughing. And Assassin, forget it... An ancient war, they said. An endless struggle. But I never cared. Who knew it was possible to bore a kid with war stories? I guess I was... lonely. Alone in a crowd. If I could have told them that, maybe they would have listened. If only I could go back. If I could tell them, I'm sorry...
