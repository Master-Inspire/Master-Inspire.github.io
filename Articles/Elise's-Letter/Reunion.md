## Reunion

* * *

I confess I'm not entirely sure what to say here. "It was good to see you again" somehow rings hollow, and empty space unfit to contain the totality of my feelings. And yet I am pleased - pleased that the Assassins have not changed you completely. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. You never were one to be easily awed.

It seems we have both found ourselves at an impasse in the hunt for my father's killer. Perhaps together, we can accomplish what neither of us alone could. It's nice to think that after all this time, we're still better together than apart.
