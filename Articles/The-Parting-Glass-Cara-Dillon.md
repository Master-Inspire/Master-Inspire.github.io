## The Parting Glass - Cara Dillon

* * *

of all the money that ere I had, I've spent it in good company,

and of all the harm that ere I've done, alas was done to none but me.

and all I've done for want of wit, to memory now I cannot recall.

so fill to me the parting glass, goodnight and joy be with you all.

of all the comrades that ere I had, they're sorry for my going away,

and of all the sweethearts that ere I've had , they wish me one more day to stay,

but since it falls unto my lot that I should rise and you should not,

I'll gently rise and I'll softly call, goodnight and joy be with you all.

a man may drink and not be drunk,

a man may fight and may not be slain,

a man may court a pretty girl and perhaps be welcome back again.

but since it has so ordered been by a time to rise and a time to fall.

come fill to me the parting glass, goodnight and joy be with you all.

come fill to me the parting glass, goodnight and joy be with you all.
