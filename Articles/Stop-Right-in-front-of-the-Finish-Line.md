Well, when I was 4, my dad bought a trusty XBox. You know, the first, ruggedy, blocky one from 2001. 

We had tons and tons and tons of fun playing all kinds of games together - until he died, when I was just 6.

I couldn't touch that console for 10 years.

But once I did, I noticed something. 

We used to play a racing game, Rally Sports Challenge. Actually pretty awesome for the time it came. 

And once I started meddling around... I found a GHOST. 

Literally.

You know, when a time race happens, that the fastest lap so far gets recorded as a ghost driver? Yep, you guessed it - his ghost still rolls around the track today. 

And so I played and played, and played, until I was almost to beat the ghost. Until one day I got ahead of it, I surpassed it, and...

I stopped right in front of the finish line, just to ensure I wouldn't delete it.

Bliss
