## The Parting Glass - Anne

* * *

Oh,All the money that e'er I had

I spent it in good company

And all the harm I've ever done

Alas, It was to none but me

And all I've done for want of wit

To memory now, I can't recall

So fill to me the parting glass

Goodnight and joy be to you all

Fill to me the parting glass

And drink a health what e'er befalls

Then gently rise and softly call

Goodnight and joy be to you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had

They're sorry for my going away

And all the sweethearts that e'er I had

They'd wish me one more day to stay

Since it fell into my lot

that I should rise and you should not

I'll gently rise and softly call

Goodnight and joy be to you all

But since it fell into my lot

That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Goodnight and joy be to you all

So fill to me the parting glass

And drink a health what e'er befalls

Then gently rise and softly call

Goodnight and joy be to you all
